<---------------------------------TODO------------------------------------------->
    - Undo method - need to undo the LAST action of the user, not the last value in the array
    - Delete method - need to delete an individual gate instead of gates with the same id 
    - Redo method
    - Rearrangment of gates
    - an output of the circuit (we'll have each gate use basic algorithm. e.g. 1+1)

<------------------------COMPLETED------------------------------------------------->
    - Clear method 
<------------------------------YEAH NAH------------------------------------------>
    - New circuit method - to be done later
